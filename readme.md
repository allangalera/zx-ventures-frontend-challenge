## Comments

I tried to build all of this on the time that was given to me but it was not enough since I was structuring Typescript that took a little more time than I thought.

I still learning tests so I did the basic on a button. I think I'm on a right path, at least ðŸ™ƒ.

Thank you for your time to review my test. I hope I meet your expectations!
